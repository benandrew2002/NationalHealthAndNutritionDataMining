# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Analysis

## Overview
This analysis focuses on the NHANES dataset, which provides information on the health, nutrition, and demographics of a diverse set of participants across the United States. 

## Cleaning Steps
- Removed null values in crucial columns such as Age, Gender, BMI, and Income.
- Filtered outliers, particularly in numeric columns like BMI.
- Ensured consistent capitalization in categorical fields.
- Removed records with invalid or impossible values (e.g., negative height/weight).

## Exploration Summary
Key questions answered in this analysis include correlations between demographic and health indicators, such as the relationship between BMI and income, age and physical activity, and income's influence on health metrics.

## Key Observations
1. **Income and BMI**: Higher income groups tend to have a healthier BMI range.
2. **Smoking and Health**: Smokers have slightly higher BMI on average.
3. **Physical Activity**: Decreases significantly with age, contributing to higher BMI in older groups.

## Follow-Up Questions
- How do regional factors impact health outcomes?
- Are there specific interventions that improve health indicators?
- How do health conditions vary with marital status or educational attainment?

## Insights and Recommendations
This dataset provides a wealth of information for public health research and can be used to tailor interventions for various demographics to improve overall health and nutrition.
